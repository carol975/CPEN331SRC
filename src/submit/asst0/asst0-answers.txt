Q1.In exception-mips1.S file, at line 137. Where the OS allocate stack space for 37 words to hold the trap frame. 
When mips_trap is called, the system is transferred to kernel mode. The control is taken-over by the trap-handler from the user. 
The interrupt is turned off when the system is taken-over by the trap-handler

Q2. In exception-mips1.s, line 69, mips_utlb_handler calls common_exception to enter kernel mode. 

Q3. So the C library can be used both in User Mode and Kernal Mode

Q4. 1. The executable files after user-level programs are compiled 
    2. and the installed system rooted at PATH. 
    "1" can be invalidated if user make changes to the user-level programs without compile the changes
    "2" user compiled the changes but did not install the new system at the root

Q5. If the behaviour of the function changes with the timers and the processors environment (i.e. how processor choose to run 
which thread or program at what time), then the function is machine dependent. Dividing tasks to multiple functions allows
some functions run concurrently which increase efficiency. It is also easy to find bugs in the code, if errors 
can only be found in a particular section of the program. Changes can be made to one section of the code while others remain 
unchanged allows efficient testing. 

Q6. 37 * 32bits or  37*4byte. For storing all 37 registers

Q7. Whever changes are made to the kernel program files

Q8. If any configuration is changed or any changes are made to kernel program files

Q9. If any changes are made to the kernel program files

Q10.In kern/startup/menu.c add the function printhw
/*
 * printhw - prints "Hello World!" to stdout
 * 
 */
 static void printhw (){
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    }
    
 
Copy the Makefile from another command folder. 
Navigate to printHW, paste the Makefile
    In Makefile change:
         PROG=printhw
         SRCS=printhw.c
         
Keep the rest the same

Re configure the os
Q11. The utilities on the host system is not compiled on the os161, and the utilities may use other program
files that are not included in os161.

Q12. The value is stored in v0 register. 

Q13. 1. Add a new entry in kern/include/kern/syscall.h
     2. Add a new case to kern/arch/mips/syscall/syscall.c:syscall() for calling the MI code
     3. Add the MI code prototype to kern/include/syscall.h
     4  Write the MI code
     5. Re configure the system
